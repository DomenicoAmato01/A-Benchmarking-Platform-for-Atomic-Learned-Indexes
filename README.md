### Paco
An order-preserving minimal perfect hash function , that maps bijectively a set of ordered keys to their ordinal position position in a given list. It assumes that keys to be hashed are ordered. The source code is written in Java and it exploits the [DSI Utilities](http://dsiutils.di.unimi.it/).
