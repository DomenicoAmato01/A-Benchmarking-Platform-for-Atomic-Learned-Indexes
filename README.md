# A Benchmarking Platform for Atomic Learned Indexes

This repository provides a benchmarking platform to evaluate how Feed Forward Neural Networks can be effectively used as index data structures. That is, how well in terms of time and space, those Networks can solve the well known predecessor problem, i.e., searching for an element in a sorted table. In theory, those networks, with RELU activators,  are able to approximate any function [1] , including the one needed to solve predecessor search. Then, a simple binary search concludes the task.  
  
The scenario we have considered is in memory data and batch queries, which is a fundamental one, as outlined in [ CSS].  
  
We include:  
  
* 3 [Neural Networks](https://github.com/DomenicoAmato01/A-Benchmarking-Platform-for-Atomic-Learned-Indexes/tree/master/src/Neural_Nets) with different number of layers  
* Different kind of Data Structures
  * [B+Trees](https://github.com/DomenicoAmato01/A-Benchmarking-Platform-for-Atomic-Learned-Indexes/tree/master/src/Data_Structures/BPtree)
  * [Css-Trees](https://github.com/DomenicoAmato01/A-Benchmarking-Platform-for-Atomic-Learned-Indexes/tree/master/src/Data_Structures/CSS)
  * [Paco and LCP](https://github.com/DomenicoAmato01/A-Benchmarking-Platform-for-Atomic-Learned-Indexes/tree/master/src/Data_Structures/Paco-Lcp)
  * [Self Adjusting Binary Trees](https://github.com/DomenicoAmato01/A-Benchmarking-Platform-for-Atomic-Learned-Indexes/tree/master/src/Data_Structures/SABT)
